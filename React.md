
**What is React?**

The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. 

It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.

React allows developers to build reusable UI components and organize the application logic into smaller, more manageable pieces.

` `React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize performance by only updating the parts of the UI that need to be updated, rather than re-rendering the entire page. React can be used with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux, React Router, and Material UI.

## **History of React JS**
React is a new technology when compared with other technologies in the market. It came into existence in 2011, when Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook created the library. React is influenced by the likes of XHP which is a simple HTML component framework for PHP. The first use case of React was in Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011.

## **Let’s look at the history of React.js on a timeline**
## **2010 – The first signs of React**
- [Facebook introduced xhp into its php stack](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/xhp-a-new-way-to-write-php/294003943919/) and open sourced it.
  Xhp allowed creating composite components. They introduced this syntax later in React.

2011 – An early prototype of React

- Jordan Walke created [FaxJS](https://github.com/jordwalke/FaxJs), the early prototype of React – shipped a search element on Facebook.

2012 – Something new had started at Face book

- Facebook Ads became hard to manage, so Facebook needed to come up with a good solution for it. Jordan Walke worked on the prototype and created React.
- April 9: [Instagram was acquired by Facebook.](http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/09/technology/facebook_acquires_instagram/index.htm)

Current version of React.JS is V18.0.0 (April 2022).

Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013.

React.JS was first used in 2011 for Face book's Newsfeed feature.

**React Features**


Currently, ReactJS gaining quick popularity as the best JavaScript framework among web developers. It is playing an essential role in the front-end ecosystem. The important features of ReactJS are as following.

- JSX
- Component-based architecture
- One-way Data Binding
- Virtual DOM
- Simplicity
- Performance
- Declarative programming
- React native

React.js comes with a range of features that make it a popular choice for building modern web and mobile applications. Some of the key features of React are:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** React.js uses a component-based architecture that allows developers to build reusable UI components. This makes it easier to manage and organize the application's UI logic, and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.
1. **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM that allows it to efficiently update the UI without re-rendering the entire page. This makes React applications fast and responsive, even for complex UIs.

1. **JSX:** React uses a syntax called JSX that allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. This makes it easier to write and maintain UI code, and enables developers to use JavaScript logic to modify the UI.

1. **One-way Data Binding:** React uses one-way data binding, which means that data flows in one direction, from parent components to child components. This makes it easier to manage the application's state and reduces the risk of bugs caused by unexpected changes in the data.
1. **React Native:** React Native is a framework that allows developers to build native mobile applications using React. This enables developers to use the same codebase for both web and mobile applications, reducing development time and costs.
1. **Declarative Programming:** React is based on declarative programming, which means that developers describe what they want the UI to look like, rather than how to create it. This makes it easier to write and maintain UI code, and reduces the risk of bugs caused by unexpected behavior.
1. **Simplicity:** ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple and to code as well as understand. We know that ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need. This makes it simple to use and learn.
1. **Performance:** ReactJS is known to be a great performer. This feature makes it much better than other frameworks out there today. The reason behind this is that it manages a virtual DOM. The DOM is a cross-platform and programming API which deals with HTML, XML or XHTML. The DOM exists entirely in memory. Due to this, when we create a component, we did not write directly to the DOM. Instead, we are writing virtual components that will turn into the DOM leading to smoother and faster performance.

React JS Keys

Let’s know what keys are----  

While dealing with components that are produced periodically in React, keys are essential.

` `Your component will continue to be uniquely identifiable after the modification if the key value is set.  They aid React in determining which elements have changed, been eliminated, or been added.

When making lists of components in React, you must use a special string personality factor "key". React uses keys to indicate which list items have been modified, destroyed, or altered. Or, to put it another way, we may say that keys are utilized to identify the components in lists. 

**Advantages of React JS -**

1. React.js builds a customized virtual DOM. Because the JavaScript virtual DOM is quicker than the conventional DOM, this will enhance the performance of apps. 
1. React JS makes an amazing UI possible.

## **Disadvantages of React JS-**

Just like with every platform or framework, in spite of its numerous benefits, React JS does have some disadvantages.

Fortunately, they are very few in number. They are:

- **Lack of adequate documentation** – in spite of there being a large community of React users and developers, there is a need for more documentation.
- **Only covers User interface** – it is not possible to develop the entire application using only react js; we need to use other languages as well.
- **High pace** – the development of applications based in React is very fast, and it can put a lot of pressure on the developer.
- **Migrating data from React Js** -can be time consuming and cumbersome; if you are unsure about the app’s future, you may have to go in a different direction for your frontend framework.
- **Setting up React** -can take more time than other popular frameworks like Vue

**React Lifecycle**
## **Lifecycle of Components**
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are:  **Mounting**, **Updating**, and **Unmounting**.
## **Mounting**
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

1. constructor()
1. getDerivedStateFromProps()
1. render()
1. componentDidMount()

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.
## **Updating**
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is *updated*.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

1. getDerivedStateFromProps()
1. shouldComponentUpdate()
1. render()
1. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
1. componentDidUpdate()

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.
## **Unmounting**
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or *unmounting* as React likes to call it.

React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

- componentWillUnmount()
### **componentWillUnmount**
The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
